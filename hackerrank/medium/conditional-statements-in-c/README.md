# Conditional Statements in C

## Problem

**Objective**

_if_ and _else_ are two of the most frequently used conditionals in C/C++, and they enable you to execute zero or one conditional statement among many such dependent conditional statements. We use them in the following ways:

1. ```if```: This executes the body of bracketed code starting with $statement1$ if $condition$ evaluates to *true*.
	
    	if (condition) {
        	statement1;
            ...
        }

2. ```if - else```: This executes the body of bracketed code starting with $statement1$ if $condition$ evaluates to *true*, or it executes the body of code starting with $statement2$ if $condition$ evaluates to *false*. Note that only *one* of the bracketed code sections will ever be executed.

		if (condition) {
        	statement1;
            ...
        }
        else {
            statement2;
        	...
        }

3. ```if - else if - else```: In this structure, dependent statements are chained together and the $condition$ for each statement is only checked if all prior conditions in the chain are evaluated to *false*. Once a $condition$ evaluates to *true*, the bracketed code associated with that statement is executed and the program then skips to the end of the chain of statements and continues executing. If each $condition$ in the chain evaluates to false, then the body of bracketed code in the *else* block at the end is executed.

		if(first condition) {
        	...
        }
        else if(second condition) {
        	...
        }
        .
        .
        .
        else if((n-1)'th condition) {
            ....
        }
        else {
        	...
        }
        
**Task**

Given a positive integer denoting $n$, do the following:

- If $1 \le n \le 9$, print the lowercase English word corresponding to the number (e.g., `one` for $1$, `two` for $2$, etc.).
- If $n \gt 9$, print `Greater than 9`.

**Input Format**

The first line contains a single integer, $n$.

**Constraints**

- $1 \le n \le 10^9$

**Output Format**

If $1 \le n \le 9$, then print the lowercase English word corresponding to the number (e.g., `one` for $1$, `two` for $2$, etc.); otherwise, print `Greater than 9` instead.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    if (n == 1) {
        printf("one\n");
    } else if (n == 2) {
        printf("two\n");
    } else if (n == 3) {
        printf("three\n");
    } else if (n == 4) {
        printf("four\n");
    } else if (n == 5) {
        printf("five\n");
    } else if (n == 6) {
        printf("six\n");
    } else if (n == 7) {
        printf("seven\n");
    } else if (n == 8) {
        printf("eight\n");
    } else if (n == 9) {
        printf("nine\n");
    } else {
        printf("Greater than 9\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

```
