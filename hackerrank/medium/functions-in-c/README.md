# Functions in C

## Problem

**Objective**

In this challenge, you will learn simple usage of functions in C. Functions are a bunch of statements grouped together. A function is provided with zero or more arguments, and it executes the statements on it. Based on the return type, it either returns nothing (void) or something.  
<br>
A sample syntax for a function is
```c
	return_type function_name(arg_type_1 arg_1, arg_type_2 arg_2, ...) {
    	...
        ...
        ...
        [if return_type is non void]
        	return something of type `return_type`;
    }
```  
For example, a function to read four variables and return the sum of them can be written as
```c
	int sum_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
    	int sum = 0;
        sum += a;
        sum += b;
        sum += c;
        sum += d;
        return sum;
    }
```

```c
+= : Add and assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

a += b is equivalent to a = a + b;
```

**Task**

Write a function `int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d)` which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them. 

**Note**  

There is not built in `max` function in C.  Code that will be reused is often put in a separate function, e.g. `int max(x, y)` that returns the greater of the two values.  

**Input Format**

Input will contain four integers - $a, b, c, d$ , one on each line.

**Constraints**

 

**Output Format**

Print the greatest of the four integers.
<br>
Note: I/O will be automatically handled.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int max_of_two(int x, int y) {
    return x > y ? x : y;
}

int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
    return max_of_two(max_of_two(a, b), max_of_two(c, d));
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c, d;
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &a, &b, &c, &d);
    printf("%d\n", max_of_four(a, b, c, d));
    return 0;
}
    

```
